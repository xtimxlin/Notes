These files included CSV, JSON, YAML, XML, flat files, and PDF formats. Working with flat files was particularly time-consuming because testers had to go through each line to extract data from specific indexes.\n' +
            '\nTask: My role was as an automation developer, and I needed to validate files generated by different subsystems. This involved collaborating with various teams, including billing, claims, rating, and underwriting, each of which had its own logic and requirements for the files.\n' +
            '\nAction: To ensure effective communication and collaboration, I worked closely with different business owners to gather detailed information about their file formats and requirements. I also discussed our approach with my manager. Together, we decided to create a new test framework to automate the testing process. This framework allowed us to configure the tests using different settings in the code and control the input through CSV files. The code would automatically collect data from the database or call APIs to fetch the data and then generate the expected files. Finally, it would compare the expected files with the actual files and create a comparison report.\n' +
